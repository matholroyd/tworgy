Tworgy
======

Website that is to serve as a general hold-all for me, Mat Holroyd. 

...essentially its a blog, but wanted to make it a bit different. Hence, each post has fictional **story** and a **factual** part...


Goals
=====

- Have both stories and serious content together
- Be able to accommodate the following examples of content

- Discussion of mobile phone cap plans, with both serious + silly story
  - Serious: Show graphs of what youd expect to pay
  - Silly: describe a future that parodies what the mobile companies would likely say is the benefit of their marketing, i.e. a future where ALL products have caps and exaggerated value, such as 1000ml of $billion milk for the price of $20

- Video game censoring, with silly story being the world that stephen conroy thinks will happen

- Discussion of diversification fallacy...story could be about warren buffett

- Walk through of climate change supporting claims (man-made climatic changes are possible, man has killed himself before without)

- Discussion of journalism


Melb Hack
=========

- Get data about activities
  - Name
  - Start/Finish
  - Location
- Process lists to update

  
Proper Tworgy Idea
==================

Aim
---

*Make it easy to find the correct twitter list to subscribe to*

Thinking good way to do this is by associating twitter lists with locations, and therefore find them via maps.

Goals
-----

*General*
- Have a google map with icons representing twitter lists
- When user clicks on icon, either take the user to the twitter page -or- bring up some details and ask user if want to follow

*Users can*
- Create lists via the service 
- Associate an existing list with a location (along with a short description)

User goals & workflow
---------------------

* Find a tworgy 
  * Display map with overlay of tworgies
* Add a tworgy
  * Associate location with existing list
    * Display map with overlay of tworgies
    * Find own lists
    * Click a list to associate with a location
    * Add a marker to screen
  * Create a list + associate with location
    * Display map with overlay of tworgies
    * 


WorkFlow
1) 
  a Login
  b Mark Location
  c Bring up form for name (filled out if choose existing tworgy)
2) 
  a Login
  b Create list new list if need be
  c Toggle whether list is associated with a map location
  d If no, grey out map, with message that need to pick map location
  d If yes, ungrey map, show pin, allow user to update position (new position automatically saved)

*Design*
- Load tworgies objects via ajax
- Display so know that have received them correctly
