h3. Overview

<b>Note on terminology</b>: We use the term 'recruiter' and 'candidate' in preference to 'interviewer' and 'interviewee', respectively, to avoid confusion for non-native English speakers.  

h4. Introduction

This article is to help guide Chinese who are looking for work in a western country, especially Australia.  It is written by a professional experienced as both a recruiter and candidate. For the sake of simplicity some statements have been generalized, and the article has been written with an Australian perspective, with the view the candidate is applying for a job in an English-speaking company.  That said, the article can be useful to Chinese applying for jobs in other countries, with other languages, and the reader should take into account their particular situation when reading and applying the following guidelines.

This article is aimed at giving a quick overview of writing a resume, as well as some specific guidelines.  The details of who is ultimately the successful candidate for a job is a large topic that will not be discussed here.  

h4. Goal of resume

The main goal of a resume is to advance the candidate to the next round of the recruitment process (for the remainder of this article, we will assume the next stage is an interview).  The resume achieves this by:
* Highlighting your suitability for the vacancy
* Providing evidence of your skills, qualifications, interests, extra-curriculum activities, etc.

h4. Highlight that you are one of the best

Typically a company will receive resumes from many people, and from these people they will want to interview a select number.  Hence your resume typically only needs to highlight your suitability, and does not need to show that you are the best. That said, your resume does need to show that you are "one of the best".

h4. Providing evidence

It is important to remember that the recruitment process is ultimately a social activity, where you as a candidate are trying to convince another human being (the recruiter) of a fact (that you are suitable for an interview). In this way your resume needs to be a persuasive document that provides compelling evidence of your qualifications, experiences, history, etc.  Before detailing how a resume provides compelling evidence, it is important to understand the ways evidence is provided.  

In a resume evidence of skills, etc. are provided by statements.  Statements in a resume can be generalized as taking one of two forms:

# *Short statements*, where facts are written with one word or a short sentence.
** Address: 123 Bridge Road, Blackwood
** Tertiary education: University of Australia, 2004-2005, Bachelor of Education
** Computer Skills: 
*** HTML
*** JavaScript
*** Ruby 
# *Long statements*, where facts are written using a full sentence, and give the author a chance to add expression.
** "While working as the junior accountant at ABC Financial Services I learned the importance of customer communication from helping the office manager implement a customer survey that would later increase customer retention by 12%."

As mentioned above, remember that a resume is a tool to communicate with another human being, and hence the same rules of what is more likely to convince another human when you talk to them applies for when writing your resume.  More specifically, it is _paramount_ to writing a good resume that you understand when to use short versus long statements. The guiding principle is that if a statement is objective, a short statement is preferred (so as to save space), but if you are trying to tell the recruiter something that is subjective, a long statement is preferred. 

Compare the following statements, which are trying to convey a subjective concept:

# "Gandhi was an important man."
# "Gandhi was an important man in India's history."
# "Gandhi was a political activist in India who was central to the movement that eventually restored Indian's sovereignty from under British colonial rule."

The statements above are all trying to convey the same information (Gandhi was an _important_ man), but they vary, from short (1), to long (3).   "Being important" is a subjective concept, hence a long statement is preferred as it is more compelling.  Below is another, more relevant example: 

# "I am hard-working." 
# "I worked hard at my last employer, ABC Finance." 
# "During my time at ABC Finance I successfully managed three client accounts whilst studying full-time at university." 

Again the statements vary from short to long. As the concept is subjective ("I am hard-working"), the last statement is the most compelling, and thus would have the most impact on a recruiter.  For a resume to be successful in convincing the recruiter of your suitability, it is important to understand when short versus long statements are required. 

h4. Summary of overview

* The goal of a resume is to progress you to the next phase in the recruitment process.
* You do not need to be _the_ best, but you do need to be _one_ of the best.
* A resume consists of short and long statements.
* Short statements are useful for objective facts; long statements for subjective facts. 


h3. Specific breakdown of a resume

In Australia there are several popular structures for a resume. For this article we will explain the general structure of a resume, and then focus on 2 specific variations that are popular in Australia, the skills-based resume and the history-based resume.  

h4. General structure of a resume

A resume's structure can be generalized into 2 overall specific sections.  The first section of a resume introduces the person.  The second section of a resume is used to highlight the qualities and experiences of the person in more details.  

h3. First section: introducing yourself

The first section of a resume is used to quickly introduce yourself, and so should include *short statements* with your:
* name
* contact details (email, mobile phone)
* address
* education (school and university)

This first section may also include:
* gender
* age
* language skills
* referee contact details
* career objectives

*Name:* Remember to specify your name in the western style, by writing given name first then family name second.

*Gender:* Stating your gender is recommended if your gender cannot be deduced from your name. For instance, the English name Kim is both a male and female name, and you should always state your gender if you only supply your Chinese name (Westerns will have no idea what your gender is). 

*Age:* Displaying your age is a matter of personal taste.  We recommend saving the space by leaving it out unless you are an unusual age for the position you are applying for, e.g. old for a entry-level job, or young for an high-level position. 

*Language Skills:* A matter of preference, some people like to put language skills in the introduction, while others like to put it at the end of the resume.  Note: State the language specifically, for instance, write "Cantonese", not "Chinese".  In terms of Chinese languages, Cantonese and Mandarin are likely the only ones that a business will be interested in.  Finally, we advise you read the notes in "Final notes for Chinese working overseas" before stating you are 'fluent' in English.

*Referee contact details:* A matter of preference. Some people like to put referees in the introduction, others like to put it at the very end. We suggest putting it at the end, so the front page is not too cluttered.

*Career objectives:* If you are applying for a position that _can_ develop into a middle-to-long-term career (6+ months), it is encouraged that you add a "career objectives" paragraph to this first section, under the listing of your name and other details.  In this paragraph you should write 2-4 sentences about what you want to achieve over the next 5+ years. 

The formatting of this section (except for 'career objectives') should be in a format that is easy for a reader to scan.  For example, use bullet points, lists or tables.

h4. Summary of first section

* First section of a resume quickly introduces the person with *short statements*.
* Should include name, contact details, address and education.
* May also include gender, age, language skills, referees and career objectives.
* The first section should be easy to scan.  Use bullet points, tables or lists.


h3. Second section: detailing your skills and experiences 

After the first, introductory section, the main part of a resume is the second section, which is used to highlight experience and skills you as a candidate have that are relevant to the job.  We highlight 2 main ways people organize this main section, and then discuss the critical importance of expressing this second section effectively. 

h4. Chronological resume

The chronological resume is the most popular style of writing a resume, where the work experiences of the candidate are written in reverse chronological order (most recent work experience first). Hence the focus is on what the candidate _has done_. For each work experience the candidate states skills, experiences and outcomes that are relevant to the job the candidate is applying for. As this style of resume is dependent on the candidate having work experience, it is most useful for those with 2 or more relevant work experiences.  

h4. Functional resume

The functional resume groups skills and work experiences of the candidate into categories, e.g. leadership, IT skills, communication skills, etc.. The focus therefore is what the candidate _can do_.  In this way a functional resume is useful when you have limited work experience that is relevant to the job you are applying for.  The functional resume can also be useful when the job states specific skill/experience requirements, or you otherwise wish to differentiate yourself from others via your unique skills and experiences. 

h4. Effectively communicating experience and skills

Assuming you are qualified for the vacancy, the second section of a resume is the most critical part of a resume. It is where the vast majority of resumes fall down. _The number one mistake of candidates when writing a resume is to simply list their experiences and skills as if they were objective_.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  A list of your experiences and skills is subjective because you are biased. 

The recruiter knows full well that you are trying to present yourself in a positive light, and thus you need to put effort into making statements that are genuine and convincing.  In other words you must avoid subjective statements like, "I am hard-working/responsible/successful", "I have strong communication skills", "I am a good programmer/accountant/lawyer", etc. As described above, long statements are more effective at convincing a recruiter.  

Before you worry too much that English is not your strong point, the good news is that there is a simple structure that you can use to convey your experiences and skills in an objective manner.  The key is to prove you have the said experience or skill by remembering a situation where you learnt from the experience or demonstrated applying a skill. Then, for each experience or skill, you should add them to your resume by describing the following:

# <b>Situation</b> _What was happening? What was wrong?_
# <b>Action</b> _What did you do?_
# <b>Outcome</b> _What happened after you took action?_

For example, perhaps you showed exceptional customer service and leadership skills one day whilst working at a cafe. Several customers had hinted that service was slow, and you took it upon yourself to talk to the other waiters to come up with a more effective service routine. As this is a positive result, you could describe this in the following manner:

# _In a chronological resume_
   <b>Cafe Australia</b>, Waiter, 2005-2007
*** Improved customer service by reacting quickly to complaints about slow service, by discussing with the waiters a better service routine.  
# _In a functional resume_
    <b>Leadership and customer service skills</b>
*** Successfully organized several waiters to combine their knowledge to improve the effectiveness of the team as whole, to overcome problematic service. This led to better customer service.

Here are the 2 versions of the experience again, with <span class='situation'>situation</span>, <span class='action'>action</span> and <span class='outcome'>outcome</span> highlighted:

* <span class='outcome'>Improved customer service</span> by <span class='action'>reacting quickly</span> to <span class='situation'>complaints about slow service</span>, by <span class='action'>discussing with the waiters a better service routine</span>.  
* <span class='action'>Successfully organized several waiters to combine their knowledge</span> to <span class='outcome'>improve the effectiveness of the team as whole</span>, to overcome <span class='situation'>problematic service</span>. This led to <span class='outcome'>better customer service</span>.


h4. Summary of second section

* The second section of a resume is the main part which should relate your skills and experiences to the job.
* There are 2 main ways to write this main section: as a chronological or a functional resume. 
* A chronological resume list work experiences in a reverse chronological order.
* A functional resume groups work experience and skills into logical categories.
* The main place where resumes fall down is in the second section.
* Writing statements that describe a *situation*, an *action* you took, and the *outcome*, is one effective way of writing this section.


h3. Final notes for Chinese working overseas

This section gives some final tips for writing your resume, specifically for Chinese.

h4. Get a native speaker to review your resume

It is strongly recommended that you have a native speaker check your resume. A resume only needs to impart correct information, and it is perfectly acceptable for someone to help you write it, for instance to check grammar and spelling.  Some universities offer resume consultation advice (check out the link to your university's career's page under the <a href='/universities/'>universities link</a>). 

h4. Language skills

Due to the large percentage of foreigners, especially from Europe, who speak excellent English, native English speakers have stricter standards for what is meant by the word 'fluent'.  If you say you are 'fluent' in English, then e.g. an Australian would expect:
* You understand (almost) every word when someone speaks
* When you speak, (almost) every word is always understood, i.e. your accent is easy to understand
* You can speak at the same speed as a native English speaker
* Your written English is grammatically correct.

Put simply, it is incorrect to say you are fluent in English if you do not meet the above criteria.  That said, _fluent_ English skills are not as critical as you may think, and many Chinese successfully find employment overseas without fluent English skills.  


h4. Miscellaneous notes 

* British and Australian people write dates in a different order to Americans, so it is recommended you write months as abbreviations instead of numbers, to avoid confusion.    E.g. write "10th Aug 2007" instead of "10/8/2007".
